StarRezApi Plugin
==========

This is a Rails plugin for the StarRez Web Services REST API and Report API. The StarRezApi
plugin leverages Ruby's metaprogramming powers to dynamically generate classes on the fly using
a combination of module mix-ins and dynamic method assignments.

The usage is certainly specific in terms of what you are attempting to do and your mileage may vary
for certain. Please review the source files for StarRezApi and StarRezReports for more specific
details on usage. All attempts have been made to mirror ActiveRecords core functionality.

You will need to provide your web services URL in the config.yml file. You can provide a different
URL For each Rails environment.

Requirements
=======

The HTTParty gem is required for this plugin. Install it with:

gem install httparty


Examples
=======

>> app/controllers/application_controller.rb

# Define a before_filter for loading StarRez classes
def create_starrez_classes
  %w(Entry Room RoomSpace).each do |table|
	unless Object.const_defined?(table)
		eval "class #{table}; include StarRezApi; include HTTParty::Icebox; end"
	end
  end
end

>> app/controllers/entry_controller.rb

# Run our before filter
before_filter :create_starrez_classes

# Display an Entry
def show
  e = Entry.find(params[:id])
end
